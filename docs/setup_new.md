# ClojureBridge Setup

_NOTE:_ These instructions are a work-in-progress any may have some rough edges!

What are the goals of these new instructions?
* Break each of the major steps into individual pages
* Show examples using Nightcode instead of Light Table
* Demonstrate using Nightcode to solve Clojure Koans
* Add IRC instructions

The examples shown here are based on Windows 7, but plaform
differences will be called out where appropriate.

Here is the recommended order of installation:

* [Join the #clojure.mn channel](setup_new_irc.md) on IRC -- so you can ask questions and get help!
* [Install the Heroku Toolbelt](setup_new_heroku.md) -- to use Heroku, git and ssh-keygen
* [Create an SSH key](setup_new_ssh.md) -- to securely login/publish to remote services
* [Setup github](setup_new_github.md) -- to publish your future projects!
* [Install Java](setup_new_java.md) -- Clojure requires Java
* [Install Leiningen](setup_new_lein.md) -- use lein to build Clojure projects
* [Getting Started with Heroku](setup_new_heroku2.md) -- run the Heroku Clojure getting started project
* [Install Nightcode](setup_new_nightcode.md) -- install the Nightcode Clojure integrated development environment
* [Try Clojure Koans in Nightcode](setup_new_koans.md) -- Try solving Clojure Koans in Nightcode

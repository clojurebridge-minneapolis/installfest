## Join the #clojurebridgemn channel

Now in the upper right search box enter **#clojurebridgemn** -- this
is the channel for ClojureBridgeMN students and volunteers. When you see the
channel listed in search results.. click on it. Then click the **Join** button

Now you ask questions and get answers right away (even after the

This is the Slack for the Clojure Community -- there are channels
for every possible topic, from core development, specific applications
and even user groups in geographic locations (for example our own
[Clojure.MN](http://www.meetup.com/clojuremn/) user's group is on **#clojuremn**)

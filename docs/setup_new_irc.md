# Join the #clojure.mn channel

## Quick Setup

The local Clojure community has a group chat room where
everyone can feel comfortable to drop in and ask any kind
of question!

The quickest way to get going is simply use the web
based client: https://webchat.freenode.net/

* Nickname: pick a name _(like your twitter name, github username, etc.)_
* Channels: clojure.mn
* Auth to services: leave unchecked

Please stop by anytime!
